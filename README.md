## Description:
We need to build a web-based application for touch typing. Touch typing is typing
without looking at the keyboard. The fundamental idea is that each finger is given its own
section of the keyboard and our fingers learn the location of the keyboard through practising
regularly and gaining muscle memory to eventually build up speed whilst typing.
While touch typing is a practice of keys, words & sentences.
